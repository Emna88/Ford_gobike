## by (Emna Krichene)


## Dataset

> This work explores Ford Go-Bike System Dataset. This data set includes information about 183412 rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.


## Summary of Findings

> **Gender** To summarize, Male represent the majority of users

> **Age** Most users are between 30 and 40 years old

> **User type** There are more susbcribers (90%) than customers

> **Session** Trips starting in early morning take less time than those starting during the rest of the day.

> **Duration** The majority of trips take less than 15 minutes. Shortest time duration was recorded early in the morning, specifically at 6AM.


> **Limitations**: By lack of time, we couldn't perform the more statistical tests and graphs


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The plots we have chosen show the distribution of the main variable "duration" based on other related variables like member gender, user type, start time and we have tried to tell a story on how these factors are influencing the duration of the trip.

> We have chosen to make some modifications in the dataset so it become more tidy: we added new columns such age, hour start time and date start time, session. These variables helped us to investigate the data in a proper manner and easily

> In our analysis, there is no surprising interaction and we find that all explorations are supporting each others.
